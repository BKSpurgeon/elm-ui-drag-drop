# MOVED TO https://github.com/arsduo/elm-dom-drag-drop

Elm's package management system (in 2018) downloads packages from Github rather than caching them directly; this means that if you rename a repo, developers can no longer install the package. In order to safely rename the package from `elm-ui-drag-drop` to `elm-dom-drag-drop` (to match the underlying library's name change from modular-ui to elm-dom), I've created a new repo rather than rename this one.
